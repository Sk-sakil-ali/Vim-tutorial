To show line numbers on left side - In normal mode command ":set number" and hit enter
We can also use H key for left, J for down K for up  and L for right instead of arrow keys in normal mode
Also in normal mode we can multiply arrow functions by multiple time by "number then arrow" for example pressing "5 and then J" will move the curser 5 line above instead of one.

By using ":set relativenumber" instead of absolute number we can get number relative to the line where curser is
By using ":set mouse=a" we can use the ,mouse also 
Whenever we close the particular file any vim setting made there will be lost whenever we close that particular file so to solve this we have to made chages to the configuration file or vim rc file
